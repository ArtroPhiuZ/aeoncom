[SUBJECT-27: MONITORING LOG]
Timestamp: 04:26 UTC
Status: Transmission active

The signal was received within the frequency range of 432.18Hz to 433.02Hz. During monitoring, a faint message could be heard through the interference: “...they are not shadows... they are watching from below...”
I don't believe this signal is of terrestrial origin. Each time I attempt decoding, there's a distinct pressure in my head—like something resisting the process. 
On several occasions, I’ve heard whispering voices, though only when I’m completely alone in the control room. I can’t explain it rationally. 

If anyone ever finds this log, heed my warning: DO NOT USE THE WORD “echo” when trying to request a retransmission.
